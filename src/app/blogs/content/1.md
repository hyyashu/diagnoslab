### Preventive Measures to Avoid Dengue

Preventing dengue fever requires a combination of individual actions and community efforts to reduce mosquito breeding and minimize the risk of mosquito bites.

**Here are some effective preventive measures:**

- **Eliminate Breeding Sites:** Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water. Regularly empty, clean, or cover containers that can hold water, such as flower pots and buckets. Ensure that water storage containers are properly covered.
- **Use Mosquito Repellents:** Apply mosquito repellents on exposed skin and clothing, especially during peak mosquito activity times, such as early morning and late evening.
- **Wear Protective Clothing:** Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks, and shoes to minimize exposed skin.
- **Install Screens and Nets:** Use window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of your home. Sleep under mosquito nets.
- **Maintain Clean Surroundings:** Regularly clean gutters and drains to prevent water accumulation.
